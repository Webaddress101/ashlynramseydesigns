            I've always been the one to sit back and observe my family members, 
            which leads me to say I've always been adament on making my own 
            path.

            So, one day I was watching a YouTube video which involved 
            a drawing of a celebrity, leading to me turning to my boyfriend and 
            saying, "what about graphic design." I grabbed my computer and 
            started searching up schools offering graphic design which is where 
            I found FIRST. I originally graduated High School in Charleston, SC 
            and two days later I decided to move to Savannah, GA. I lived there 
            for almost a year than one day I was on the phone with my older 
            sister and she brought up the idea of my boyfriend and I moving to 
            Wisconsin with her and now I live in Wisconsin with my sister while 
            attending class at FIRST. Going back to when I lived in Savannah my 
            dad was a KJ where he would go to different locations and host 
            karaoke nights. Growing up I was always around stuff like that and 
            so my hobby became singing which has become a passion of mine and is 
            also a huge part of my life. Usually when I meet people they 
            wouldn't notice that I'm a huge introvert and I just love to stay 
            home in my bed and binge on my shows and watch movies.
