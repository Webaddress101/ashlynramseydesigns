                I've always been the one to sit back and observe my family members, 
                which leads me to say I've always been adament on making my own 
                path.

                I graduated my High School in Charleston, SC and ended up moving
                to Savannah, Ga shortly after. For awhile, I just couldn't 
                decide what I wanted to do with my life. Then, one day I was 
                watching a YouTube video which involved a drawing of a 
                celebrity, which got me thinking, "what about graphic design?" 
                I grabbed my computer and started searching up schools offering
                graphic design which is where I found my college F.I.R.S.T. 
                Institue. After a few months I decided to move to Wisconsin
                with my now fiance and family. Still attending F.I.R.S.T online.
                Growing up I was always around music and artsy things. Music
                has always been a passion of mine. Leading me to say that 
                singing is my hobby and a bige part of my life. Meeting new 
                people growing up I was anxious and scared, I still am at times. 
                Ever sense I've become a student at F.I.R.S.T. that's brought me
                out of my shell. Although, I do love a good stay at home in my 
                bed and binge on my shows and watch movies all day days.
