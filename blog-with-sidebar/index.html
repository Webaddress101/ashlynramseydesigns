                    The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled 
                    dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic 
                    family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double 
                    coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, 
                    and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.

                    Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they 
                    are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling 
                    and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient 
                    breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and 
                    harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, 
                    a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, 
                    during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work 
                    the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise 
                    impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is 
                    typically kept as a house pet, though they are still 
                    frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and 
                    recreational mushers.

                    The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi 
                    people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They 
                    were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working 
                    sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled 
                    dog racing. In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the 
                    Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky 
                    share a close genetic relationship between each other and 
                    were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were 
                    separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and 
                    the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and 
                    the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and 
                    had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which 
                    was developed through crossing with European breeds. 
                    Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical 
                    East Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can 
                    be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old.

                    Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a 
                    significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr 
                    wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are 
                    associated with high latitudes – the Siberian Husky and 
                    Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human 
                    populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei and 
                    Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of 
                    between 1 and 3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the 
                    ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. 
                    This introgression could have provided early dogs living in 
                    high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for 
                    adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also 
                    indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends 
                    from more than one region.

                <p>
                    <b>Coat</b>
                    <p>
                        A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker 
                        than that of most other dog breeds. It has two 
                        layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer 
                        topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs. It 
                        protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic 
                        winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is 
                        able to withstand temperatures as low as −50 to −60 °C 
                        (−58 to −76 °F). The undercoat is often absent during 
                        shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An 
                        excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a 
                        "wooly" or "woolie" coat, is considered a fault by the 
                        breed's standard as it lacks the thicker protection of 
                        the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's 
                        clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during 
                        serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and 
                        encrusted with snow and ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and 
                        patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial 
                        markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are 
                        black and white, copper-red and white, grey and 
                        white, pure white, and the rare "agouti" coat, 
                        though many individuals have blondish or piebald 
                        spotting. Some other individuals also have the 
                        "saddle back" pattern, in which black-tipped guard 
                        hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the 
                        head, haunches and shoulders are either light red 
                        or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other 
                        facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat 
                        colors from black to pure white are allowed. 
                        Merle coat patterns are not permitted by the 
                        American Kennel Club (AKC) and The Kennel Club 
                        (KC). This pattern is often associated with 
                        health issues and impure breeding.
                    </p>
                    <b>Eyes</b>
                    <p>
                        The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian 
                        Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately 
                        spaced and set slightly obliquely." The AKC 
                        breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue 
                        or black; one of each or particoloured are 
                        acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These 
                        eye-color combinations are considered acceptable 
                        by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does 
                        not affect the vision of the dog.
                    </p>
                    <b>Nose</b>
                    <p>
                        Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither 
                        pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in 
                        gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored 
                        dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some 
                        instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is 
                        called "snow nose" or "winter nose." This condition 
                        is called hypopigmentation in animals. "Snow nose" 
                        is acceptable in the show ring.
                    </p>
                    <b>Tail</b>
                    <p>
                        Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs 
                        will often curl up with their tails over their faces 
                        and noses in order to provide additional warmth. 
                        When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover 
                        its nose for warmth, often referred to as the 
                        "Siberian Swirl". The tail should be expressive, held 
                        low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a 
                        "sickle" shape when excited or interested in something.
                    </p>
                    <b>Size</b>
                    <p>
                        The breed standard indicates that the males of the 
                        breed are ideally between 20 and 24 inches 
                        (51 and 61 cm) tall at the withers and weighing 
                        between 45 and 60 pounds (20 and 27 kg). Females 
                        are smaller, growing to between 19 and 23 inches 
                        (48 and 58 cm) tall at the withers and weighing 
                        between 35 and 50 pounds (16 and 23 kg). 
                        The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies 
                        as "Siberian Rats" due to their size of 40–50 lb 
                        (18–23 kg), versus the Alaskan Malamute's size of 
                        75–85 lb (34–39 kg).
                    </p>
                    <b>Behavior</b>
                    <p>
                        The Husky usually howls instead of barking. They 
                        have been described as escape artists, which can 
                        include digging under, chewing through, or even 
                        jumping over fences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the Siberian Husky had been raised in a 
                        family setting by the Chukchi and not left to 
                        fend for themselves, they could be trusted with 
                        children. The ASPCA classifies the breed as 
                        good with children. It also states they exhibit 
                        high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, 
                        and may be destructive "without proper care".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to 
                        the Chukchi allowing them to roam free in the 
                        summer. The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on 
                        wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with 
                        training can be trusted with other small 
                        animals. They would only return to the Chukchi 
                        villages when the snow returned and food became 
                        scarce. Their hunting instincts can still be 
                        found in the breed today, noted by their 
                        typically high prey-drive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence is recommended for this 
                        breed as a pet, although some have been known 
                        to overcome fences as high as 8 ft (2.44 m). 
                        Electric pet fencing may not be effective. 
                        They need the frequent companionship of people 
                        and other dogs, and their need to feel as part 
                        of a pack is very strong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The character of the Siberian Husky is friendly 
                        and gentle. The Husky cannot be used as a 
                        guard dog; Siberian Huskies typically have 
                        no aggression towards humans. In addition, 
                        the breed often shows independence, which 
                        is a disadvantage for service dogs. 
                        Attempting to teach Siberian Huskies 
                        aggressive behavior can lead to mental 
                        problems in the dog. It can be dangerous 
                        for the owner. The dog is intelligent, but 
                        can be stubborn because of its independence, 
                        impulsivity and inattention. To achieve obedience 
                        it is highly beneficial to start training at an early 
                        age.

                        Siberian Huskies were ranked 77th out of 138 compared 
                        breeds for their intelligence by canine psychologist 
                        Stanley Coren. However, the rankings in Coren's 
                        published work utilized only one of three defined 
                        forms of dog intelligence, "Working and Obedience 
                        Intelligence", which focused on trainability—a 
                        dog's ability to follow direction and commands 
                        in a direct context, specifically by trial judges 
                        in a controlled course setting. The Siberian Husky's 
                        work as a sled dog, with minimal active direction 
                        from a driver, and a driver's reliance on the dogs 
                        to make their own decisions in poor conditions, 
                        utilizes the other two forms, 
                        "Instinctive Intelligence" and "Adaptive 
                        Intelligence", to a much greater extent.

                    A 1999 ASPCA publication shows the average life span of 
                    the Siberian Husky is 12 to 14 years. Health issues in the 
                    breed are mainly genetic, such as seizures and defects of 
                    the eye (juvenile cataracts, corneal dystrophy, canine 
                    glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy) and congenital 
                    laryngeal paralysis. Hip dysplasia is not often found in 
                    this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized 
                    canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation for 
                    Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out 
                    of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with 
                    only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing 
                    dysplasia.

                    Siberian Huskies used for sled racing may also be prone 
                    to other ailments, such as gastric disease, bronchitis or 
                    bronchopulmonary ailments ("ski asthma"), and gastric 
                    erosions or ulcerations.

                    Modern Siberian Huskies registered in the US are almost 
                    entirely the descendants of the 1930 Siberia imports and 
                    of Leonhard Seppala's dogs, particularly Togo. The 
                    limited number of registered foundational dogs has led 
                    to some discussion about their vulnerability to the founder 
                    effect.
