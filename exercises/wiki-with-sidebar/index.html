                    and a fictional seaside town in Maine called

                    his wife and daughter.

                    Once Upon a Time is created by Lost and Tron: Legacy 
                    writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. The core 
                    themes of the show are hope and optimism. Horowitz 
                    told The Hollywood Reporter that they had a conscious 
                    purpose to "do a show that had optimism at its heart", 
                    as they "felt like there was so much darkness in the 
                    world". Kitsis said: "We are guys who like to see the 
                    world as half-full, not half-empty", and it's about 
                    "seeing that among all the trials and tribulations of 
                    life, you can persevere and find light among the 
                    darkness";<sup>[2]</sup> "it's that ability to think 
                    your life will get better".<sup>[3]</sup> Star Jennifer 
                    Morrison told the Calgary Herald that it's a show about 
                    hope and positivity and connectivity, which "encourages 
                    people to believe in themselves and believe in the best 
                    versions of themselves and to have hope to have the 
                    life that they have."<sup>[4]</sup>

                    A spin-off series, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, 
                    consisting of 13 episodes featuring the title character 
                    of the 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by 
                    Lewis Carroll, premiered on October 10, 2013, and 
                    concluded on April 3, 2014.<sup>[5]</sup>

                <p>
                    Eight years before the pilot began development (the two had 
                    just completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and 
                    Horowitz became inspired to write fairy tales out of a love 
                    of "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different 
                    worlds."<sup>[29]</sup> They presented the premise to numerous networks, 
                    but were refused due to its fantastical nature.<sup>[30]</sup> From their 
                    time on Lost, the writers learned to look at the story in a 
                    different way,<sup>[30]</sup> namely that "character has to trump 
                    mythology."<sup>[28]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis conceived Once Upon a Time 
                    in 2004 before joining the writing staff of Lost, but wanted 
                    to wait until that series was over to focus on this project.

                    During the first six seasons, the Enchanted Forest 
                    and Storybrooke, Maine are the main settings of the 
                    series.<sup>[82]</sup> The Enchanted Forest is a 
                    realm within Fairy Tale Land, but the actual spread 
                    and scope of the realm is not known. However, they 
                    are later united during the Ogre Wars, which played 
                    a part in the formation of the War Council that is 
                    formed by Prince Charming and served as the catalysts 
                    in the backstories involving Rumplestiltskin and the 
                    Evil Queen. Several independent kingdoms are implied 
                    by an array of different rulers. Most of the stories 
                    detailed their earlier lives before ascension to power 
                    and being influenced by their mentors through their 
                    upbringings. Meanwhile, Storybrooke serves as an 
                    isolated town separated from the rest of the Land 
                    Without Magic, where the cursed inhabitants are trapped 
                    by various forces.

                    During the seventh season, the New Enchanted Forest and 
                    Hyperion Heights, Seattle are the main settings.
                    <sup>[83]</sup> As a realm in New Fairy Tale Land, the 
                    New Enchanted Forest is divided into several independent 
                    kingdoms with different rulers. The inhabitants are in 
                    conflict with each other, most notably between Lady 
                    Tremaine, Cinderella, Drizella, a resistance led by 
                    Tiana, and the Coven of the Eight led by Mother Gothel. 
                    Most flashbacks involved events that happened before the 
                    original curse and before the latest curse that brought 
                    everyone to Hyperion Heights, where unlike Storybrooke, 
                    its cursed inhabitants are living among ordinary people.
